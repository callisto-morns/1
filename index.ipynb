In our lab, headed by Dr. Shannon Quinn at the University of Georgia, the use of Jupyter Notebook has streamlined tasks such as data visualization, data preparation, calculations and the sharing of our results. As students, the user-friendly functionality and display of Jupyter Notebook has been instrumental in our ability to learn from each other’s findings. We will explore our use of Jupyter Notebook throughout our most recent research, conducted for the Parkinson’s Disease Digital Biomarker DREAM Challenge, a recent open challenge from Sage Bionetworks. The motivation for the challenge is derived from the effects of Parkinsonian motor symptoms on everyday motor activities. Task-related motion-sensor time series data was provided, and challenge participants were asked to use this data to extract meaningful features which indicate the presence and severity of Parkinsonian motor symptoms. \n",
